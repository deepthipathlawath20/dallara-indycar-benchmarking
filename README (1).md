# Dallara IndyCar Factory — Benchmarking & Quality/Process Analysis

**Report (PDF):** [Dallara_IndyCar_Quality_Benchmarking.pdf](./Dallara_IndyCar_Quality_Benchmarking.pdf)

## Overview
Evaluation of Dallara IndyCar Factory’s quality system and operations with benchmarking against elite motorsport/manufacturing peers. Focus areas include certification upgrades, supplier quality, standard work, SPC dashboards, and flow/WIP control. This project frames ISO‑aligned recommendations to improve resilience, throughput, and customer outcomes.

## Highlights
- Sole chassis supplier for the NTT INDYCAR Series; capabilities in **composites, wind tunnel, DIL simulation, aerodynamics, telemetry**.
- Long-term partnerships (INDYCAR through 2027) and academic collaboration support innovation.
- Recommendation to upgrade **ISO 9001:2008 → ISO 9001:2015**; consider **IATF 16949** (auto) / **AS9100** (aero) strategically.
- Data-driven QMS: digital traceability, telemetry feedback loops, SPC on key dimensions (Cp/Cpk), visible KPI boards.

## Recommendations (summary)
1. QMS upgrades and audit-ready change control.
2. Digital work instructions; standard work & visual management.
3. Supplier scorecards + risk-based incoming inspection; PPAP-like gates.
4. Throughput/flow: takt-based line balance; Kanban WIP control; reduce changeover.
5. SPC/QC dashboards; CAPA with root-cause rigor.
6. Prototype speed with AM; tighter loops with simulation/digital twins.
7. Training matrix and certification for special processes.

## KPIs to Track
OEE • FPY • DPU/PPM • Composite defect/tolerance rates • MTBF/MTTR • On-time delivery • Audit pass % • Supplier PPM • Post-race CSAT/issue rate
